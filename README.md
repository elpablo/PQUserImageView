### Description
**PQUserImageView** is a UIView subclass that allows to draw an image with a cirular mask.

### Usage
Drag the **PQUserImageView.{h,m}** files into your project and then you can use it via code, by passing to it an image, a ring color and width or directly by placing a UIView into the *Interface Builder* and assigning to it the **PQUserImageView** as class name.

The view will draw directly the masked image and Interface Builder will expose the PQUserImageView's parameters to customize the view appearance.
